# COMPSCI 230 Computer Systems Principles
# Assembly Language Lab

In this lab we will use `objdump` on a simple C program. You will be asked to
answer a few questions about the output of `objdump` on Gradescope.

To start working on this lab you must be logged in to the Edlab and in your
`cs230` directory. From this directory run the command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/umass-cs-230/230-lab-binary-bomb
```

In the folder you just downloaded, you will find a binary file `fibonacci`, as
well as a C file `fibonacci.c`. The C file is incompleteâ€”the implementation of
function `count()` is left out. (Do not compile it.) You will need to use
`objdump` to find out what this function does.

Run the following to disassemble the binary and save the generated assembly listing
to a file `output.txt`:

```
$ objdump -d fibonacci > output.txt
```

Open the `output.txt` file and find the assembly for `main`. With the help of
`fibonacci.c`, answer the following questions on Gradescope:

1. How many bytes are assigned for the stack frame for `main` right before
`fibonacci()` is called (before executing `call` instruction)?
2. How many bytes are assigned for the stack frame for `main` right before
`count()` is called (before executing `call` instruction)?
3. What integer values, register values or corresponding C variables are stored
at the following location within the `main` stack frame?
  * `-0x4(%ebp)`
  * `-0xc(%ebp)`
  * `-0x10(%ebp)`

Next, find the assembly for `fibonacci`. With the help of `fibonacci.c`, answer
the following questions on Gradescope:

1. Where are the following values stored on the stack frame for `fibonacci`?
Please answer using the format `D(%ebp)`, where `D` specifies displacement
offset.
  * `len`
  * `seq[0]`
  * `i`
2. In a couple of sentences, explain what is the purpose of each of the
following instructions. Please take note of the instruction offset (e.g., 121d)
so that there is no confusion exactly which instruction you are asked to
explain. If an instruction contains registers, you will also need to explain
what integer values or corresponding C variables are stored in these registers.
  * `121d:       c1 e0 02                shl    $0x2,%eax`
  * `1224:       e8 fc ff ff ff          call   1225 <fibonacci+0x16>`
  * `1250:       05 ff ff ff 3f          add    $0x3fffffff,%eax`
  * `1275:       01 d0                   add    %edx,%eax`
  * `128a:       89 10                   mov    %edx,(%eax)`
  * `1293:       3b 45 08                cmp    0x8(%ebp),%eax`
  * `1298:       8b 45 f0                mov    -0x10(%ebp),%eax`

The easiest way to find answers to this question is to annotate every line of the
assembly for `fibonacci` as to what each instruction does.

Finally, look at the assembly for `count`, and annotate each line of the
instructions for `count`. Do the following on Gradescope:
1. In a couple of sentences, describe what `count` does.
2. Please copy the assembly for `count`, with your annotations, into a separate
text file called `annotated_count.txt`, and upload it to Gradescope. (Please
include the assembly and your annotations for `count` only.)
